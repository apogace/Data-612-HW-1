In this first assignment, I selected the dataset with numerous players, the year they played, the team ID, the league, and the player ID. 
First, I showed the first five rows at the top of the dataset and then the dataset's last five rows. 
Next, I printed the columns. There were five total
The data was structured in a pandas data frame. The year and salary info was an integer datatype, while the team ID, lgID, and player ID were all object datatypes
The shape of the data frame was 26428, 5. Meaning there were five columns and 26428 rows.
Finally, I looked at the mean salary grouped by the year and team. From this analysis, I noticed that 1991,1993, and 1995 showed salaries unusually higher than all other years, and the teams CAL, ML4, and MON showed salary means much higher than other teams.
